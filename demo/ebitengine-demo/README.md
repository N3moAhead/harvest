# Ebiten Demo

I wanted to try out diffrent kinds of rendering engines before choosing one.

The first one i wanted to try is Ebiten its very simple to use and is fully
written in Golang. Which makes it easy to install and use across Plattforms.

To run the provided program on linux you can run:
```bash
go run cmd/test/main.go
```
For windows you can run:
```bash
go run cmd\test\main.go
```

**Tip** If you are on linux and have make installed you can just run make
